# Deep Linking in Mobile Apps

## What is Deep Linking?
Deep Linking enables an app to navigate directly to a specific screen when a particular URL is opened.

For example, if a user shares a product link with a friend, and clicking the link opens the product page inside the app instead of a web browser, this is deep linking.

## Types of Deep Linking
1. **Traditional Deep Linking**
2. **Deferred Deep Linking**
3. **Dynamic Deep Linking (Firebase Dynamic Links)**

---

### 1. Traditional Deep Linking
Traditional deep linking uses a predefined URL scheme that works only if the app is already installed.

**Example:**
```
myapp://product/123
```
This link will only work if the app is installed; otherwise, it will not function.

**Limitations:**
- Does not work if the app is not installed.
- Requires custom URL schemes, which are not universal.

---

### 2. Deferred Deep Linking
Deferred deep linking works even if the app is not installed at the time of clicking the link.

**How It Works:**
1. If the app is not installed, the user is redirected to the Play Store for installation.
2. After installation, the app automatically opens to the intended screen.

**Use Cases:**
- Marketing campaigns
- Referral programs
- User acquisition strategies

**Example:**
If a referral invite link is sent to a new user, after installation, the app should open the referral offer page directly.

### 3. Dynamic Deep Linking (Firebase Dynamic Links)
Firebase Dynamic Links combine both traditional and deferred deep linking, working seamlessly across Android, iOS, and the web.

**Example:**
```
https://myapp.page.link/product123
```

**How It Works:**
- If the app is **installed**, it opens directly to the correct screen.
- If the app is **not installed**, the user is redirected to the Play Store. After installation, the correct screen opens automatically.

**Advantages:**
- Works across multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Web)  
- Provides seamless user onboarding  
- Ideal for advertising, social media sharing, and app promotions

## Conclusion
Deep linking enhances user experience by ensuring smooth navigation within an app. Whether using traditional, deferred, or Firebase Dynamic Links, implementing deep linking can significantly improve user engagement and app usability.
